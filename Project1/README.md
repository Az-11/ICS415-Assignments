# ICS415-Assignment1

## Ray Tracing in Java

Welcome to my first HW in ICS415 ( Computer Graphics ). This is simple implementation of a ray tracing algorithm written in Java. This program demonstrates the basics of ray tracing by rendering a 2D image with multiple spheres, showcasing intersections and color blending. The output image is saved as `ray_tracing_output.png` in the project directory.

## Features
- **Ray Tracing Algorithm**: Simulates light rays and sphere intersections.
- **Customizable Scene**: Modify sphere properties (position, color, radius) easily.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Requirements
To run this program, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 8 or higher): [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository (optional).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Az-11/ICS415-Assignment1.git
   cd ICS415-Assignment1
   ```

### Compile and Run

#### Windows
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ICS415-Assignment1
   ```
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac RayTracing.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java RayTracing
   ```
5. The output image `ray_tracing_output.png` will be saved in the project folder.

#### macOS/Linux
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ICS415-Assignment1
   ```
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac RayTracing.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java RayTracing
   ```
5. The output image `ray_tracing_output.png` will be saved in the project folder.
