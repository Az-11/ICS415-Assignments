# ICS415 - Assignments & Projects

This repository contains assignments and projects for the **ICS415** course. The projects focus on **Ray Tracing**, **Shader Programming** and others, implementing fundamental graphics techniques.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Project 1: Ray Tracing (Completed ✅)
- **Objective:** Implement a basic ray tracer in any programming language.
- **Implementation:** Ray Tracer written in **Java**.
- **Resources:**
  - "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley
  - "Computer Graphics from Scratch: A Programmer’s Introduction to 3D Rendering"

### 🔹 Project 2: Shader Programming (Completed ✅)
- **Objective:** Write a fragment shader that applies a filter to an image.
- **Implementation:** Shader written in **GLSL**.
- **Resources:**
  - Shader Basics
  - "An Introduction to Shader Art Coding"
  - Shader Tutorial Series
  - Unity Shader Programming Guide
 
### 🔹 Project 3: Minecraft‑like Voxel Engine (Completed ✅)
- **Objective:** Build a real‑time voxel engine in Java using LWJGL and JOML.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Chunked mesh generation, texture atlas, lighting, camera controls, block placement/destruction with physics‑driven debris.  
- **Resources:**  
  - LWJGL 3 documentation  
  - JOML (Java OpenGL Math Library)  
  - OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile tutorials  

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
